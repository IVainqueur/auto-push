**--commit* *       is a template for the commit message. Default is 'auto-commit-[uuid]
        For example: if --commit='auto-commit' then all the commit message will be 'auto-commit-[uuid]'.
        Note: You can also put the uuid anywhere else in the string like so: --commit='commit-#num#-automatic'
The --commit above will be turned into 'custom-[uuid]-automatic'
